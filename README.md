### About, or "The new phone of the future!"
iPear XS is the brand new cell phone *simulator* with a lot of features for Windows. It allows you to control your Wi-Fi settings on your PC, ~~call real phone numbers~~, ~~change PC time and keyboard layout~~, ~~calculate big numbers~~, ~~browse the internet~~, ~~listen to music~~, ~~message your friends~~, and so much more! It's designed to be funny and serious, boring and interesting, ~~it can even be customized whatever you want it  to look like~~... Well, it has also features of ~~adding your own applications~~ and sharing all your data with the developer (In Security Settings, yeah) >:D I hope you have a nice day :D and now you can proceed to read the next section.
